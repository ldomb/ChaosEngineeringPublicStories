# Public Chaos Engineering Stories / Implementations

**Why Chaos Engineering Public Stories?**

We are still in the early stages of widespread adoption of chaos engineering across industries. As a Chaos Engineering community, we should therefore highlight the great efforts and stories of organizations in the space of chaos engineering, what did work and what did not, so that others can learn from these efforts and excel in their own resilience and chaos engineering journey.
